# ARM-processor
implementing the ARM processor in 4 versions (pipeline, forwarding, cache, SRAM)

The pipeline version is the basic form of implementing the ARM processor.

The forwarding version is the second version of pipeline which a forwarding unit is added so we can have a faster performance.

The SRAM version is the 3rd version which simulates a S-RAM so the performance would be more realistic.

The cache version is the 4th version which includes a cache module that caches some data read from SRAM (faster performance compared to previous version)
